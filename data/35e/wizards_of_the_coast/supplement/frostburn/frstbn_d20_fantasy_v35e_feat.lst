Altitude Adaptation			TYPE:General								PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2																																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your body adapts quickly to changes in altitude, preventing you from suffering as much from altitude sickness.																																																																																			SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws to avoid the effects of altitude. Additionally, when you determine what effect the altitude has on you, you apply the effect for the next lower category of altitude than the category you are actually in. After you spend a week at a specific altitude, you become acclimated to that altitude and all lower altitudes, and no longer have to make Fortitude saving throws for each 6-hour period to avoid altitude sickness. If you travel to a lower altitude and remain there for a week, you lose your acclimation to the higher altitude and must reacclimatize, although you always retain the other benefits granted by this feat.
Arctic Priest				TYPE:General																						PREDOMAIN:1,Cold,Winter																																																																																																																																																																																										DESC:You can swap out prepared spells to cast spells to aid in exploring and surviving in frostfell areas.																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	BENEFIT:You can channel stored spell energy into spells that aid in exploring and surviving in the frostfell, even if you did not prepare these spells ahead of time. You can lose any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any of the spells that appear on the list below, as long as the spell to be cast is of an equal or lower level to the one you lose. Spells you can spontaneously cast when using this feat include: control weather, create food and water, endure elements, heroes feast, hibernate, protection from energy, and resist energy.
Beckon the Frozen				TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:2,Augment Summoning,Spell Focus(Conjuration)																																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:Creatures you summon are infused with cold energy and have the cold subtype.																																																																																									SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:When you summon a creature or creatures using any summon spell, you can opt to summon a version of the creature from an extraplanar frostfell. If you do so, the summoned creature gains the cold subtype, and its natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. Creatures with the fire subtype can never be enhanced with the cold subtype in this manner.
Chosen of Iborighu			TYPE:General																		PREDEITY:1,Iborighu																																																																																																																																																																																														DESC:Your skin has a noticeable blue tint and your left eye is pale blue (your right eye is some other color); these features identify you as an ally to the church of Iborighu and grant you supernatural qualities.																				TEMPLATE:Chosen of Iborighu																																											SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:Your left eye radiates faint evocation magic if it is viewed with a detect magic spell, and faint evil if viewed with a detect evil spell. Cleric is now a favored class for you; the cleric class does not count when determining whether you take an experience point penalty for multiclassing. Once per day, you can cause one creature within 30 feet that meets your gaze to become overwhelmed with a wave of supernatural cold. The target can resist the effects of this attack with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier), otherwise it causes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier + 3 (minimum 1 point of damage) and causes the victim to become fatigued. If you use this attack against someone who is fatigued, they instead become exhausted. Using this supernatural ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Special: If you ever lose favor with Iborighu, or change your patron deity to another deity, you lose all benefits of this feat but your unusual skin color and eye color remain. You do not gain a replacement feat. If you later return to Iborighus faithful and receive an atonement spell, you regain the benefits of the feat.
Cold Endurance				TYPE:General.Fighter							PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2																																																																		SAB:+2 on saving throws against cold effects																																																																																																																														DESC:Either because of growing up in a frostfell or training your body and mind to ignore the biting effect of cold, you can exist with ease in low-temperature environments.																																																																										SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:You can exist comfortably in conditions between 0 F and 90 F without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in Cold Dangers, page 8). You also gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against cold effects. Cold Endurance doesnt provide any level of resistance to cold damage.
Cold Focus					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your cold spells are more potent than normal.																																																												BONUS:DC|DESCRIPTOR.Cold|1																														SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells you cast with the cold descriptor. This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such as those granted by Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus.
Cold Spell Specialization		TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:2,Snowcasting,Frozen Magic																	PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:You do additional damage with cold spells.																																																																																															SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40 F), you gain a +1 bonus per die to any dice rolled to determine damage caused by cold spells you cast. For example, if an 11th-level wizard with this feat casts a cone of cold in a cold area, the spell does 11d6+11 points of damage. In areas of extreme cold (below-20 F), the damage bonus increases to +2 per die.
Craft Skull Talisman			TYPE:ItemCreation													PRECLASS:1,Spellcaster=6																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:You can create skull talismans, which carry spells within themselves																																																																																										SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:You can create a skull talisman of any spell you know and that targets one or more creatures. Crafting a skull talisman takes one day. When you create a skull talisman, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a skull talisman is its spell level  its caster level  100 gp. To craft the talisman, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (mostly comprised of the rare metallic inks needed to inscribe the runes of power on the skull) costing one-half this base price.
Faith in the Frost			TYPE:General																						PREDOMAIN:1,Cold,Winter	PREFEAT:1,Turn Undead																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:You channel frozen energies from your deity when you turn or rebuke creatures.																																																																																									SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:When you successfully turn or rebuke a creature, it takes cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier as blasts of ice and cold energy tear through its body.
Frostfell Prodigy				TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:3,Snowcasting,Frozen Magic,Cold Focus															PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:You gain additional bonus spells in cold regions.																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40 F), the ability score used to determine how many bonus spells you may prepare or cast is treated as if it were 2 higher than its actual score. If you enter an area with a warmer temperature and remain in this area for longer than 1 minute, the bonus spells granted by this feat are lost until you can regain them. In areas of extreme cold (below -20 F), the ability score is treated as if it were 4 higher than its actual score for purposes of determining how many bonus spells you can prepare or cast.
Frozen Berserker				TYPE:General.Fighter																									PREFEAT:1,Rage																																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:When you enter your barbarian rage, your body becomes infused with cold energy.																																																																																								SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:As long as you are under the effects of a barbarian rage, you gain the cold subtype. You gain immunity to cold, but have vulnerability to fire, which means you take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
Frozen Magic				TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Snowcasting																			PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:Your cold spells are more powerful when you cast them in a cold region.																																																																																										SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40 F), spells with the cold descriptor cast by you manifest at caster level +1. In areas of extreme cold (below -20 F), cold spells cast by you manifest at caster level +2.
Frozen Wild Shape				TYPE:General								PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=6														PREFEAT:1,Wild Shape																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:You can assume the form of magical beasts with the cold subtype.																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:You may use your wild shape ability to assume the form of any magical beast with the cold subtype. Your new form must still fall within the size limitations of your wild shape ability.
Greater Cold Focus			TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Cold Focus																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Your cold spells are now even more potent than before.																																																											BONUS:DC|DESCRIPTOR.Cold|1																														SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells with the cold descriptor. This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such as those from Cold Focus, Spell Focus, and Greater Spell Focus.
Icy Calling					TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Snowcasting																			PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:Your summon spells work better in the frostfell if you summon native creatures.																																																																																								SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:In cold areas (temperature at or below 40 F), creatures native to cold environments and creatures with the cold subtype summoned by you are more powerful and agile than normal. The summoned creatures gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity for the duration of the spell that summoned them. In areas of extreme cold (below -20 F), any summoned creature affected by this feat has maximum hit points when summoned.
Ice Harmonics				TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Bardic Music														PRESKILL:1,Perform (Sing)=6																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:You can use your voice to shatter ice.																																																																																															SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you can cause any unattended nonmagical ice object or portion of ice to explode violently. The target must be within 30 feet, and you must be able to sing in order to shatter the ice. Any creature located in the 5-foot square in which you target with this ability takes piercing damage equal to 2d6 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures made of ice that you specifi- cally target with this effect take double damage.
Improved Cold Endurance			TYPE:General.Fighter							PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=6														PREFEAT:1,Cold Endurance																																			PREVARLT:COUNT[FEATNAME=Improved Cold Endurance],3																																																																																																																																										DESC:Your training and natural hardiness have improved your natural resistance to cold temperatures.																											STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE											ADD:FEAT|1|Cold Resistance																																						SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	BENEFIT:You gain resistance to cold 5. If you already have resistance to cold, it increases by 5 (maximum resistance to cold 15).
Improved Frosty Touch			TYPE:General.Fighter																																		PRERACE:1,Uldra																																																																																																																																																																														DESC:Your frosty touch causes more cold damage.																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|FrostyTouchDmg|1			SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:Your frosty touch ability now deals 2 points of cold damage.
Mark of Hleid				TYPE:General																		PREDEITY:1,Hleid																																																																																																																																																																																															DESC:You bear a birthmark in the shape of the holy symbol of Hleid (a ragged white triangle with a vortex of blue flame in its center) somewhere on your body; this mark identifies you as an ally of the church of Hleid and grants you supernatural qualities.													TEMPLATE:Mark of Hleid																																												SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:The actual birthmark itself radiates faint abjuration magic if it is viewed with a detect magic spell, and faint good if viewed with a detect good spell. You are immune to the frost touch special attack of a rimefire eidolon. Additionally, you can handle rimefire ice barehanded without taking any cold damage. Cleric is now a favored class for you; the cleric class does not count when determining whether you take an experience point penalty for multiclassing. You gain a +2 sacred bonus to your Armor Class against evil-aligned creatures with the cold subtype.
Mountaineer					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:You are a particularly gifted explorer and mountain climber.																																																															BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Survival|2																									SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:You get a +2 bonus on all Climb and Survival checks.
Piercing Cold				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your cold spells are so cold that they can damage creatures normally resistant or immune to cold.																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																			SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:You can only apply this metamagic feat to spells with the cold descriptor. Piercing cold spells are so horribly cold that they are capable of damaging creatures normally unharmed by or resistant to cold. Piercing cold spells completely ignore any resistance to cold a creature possesses, bypassing this resistance and dealing damage to the target as if it did not possess any resistance to cold at all. They are still entitled to whatever other defenses the attack allows (such as saving throws and spell resistance). Creatures normally immune to cold can be damaged by piercing cold spells as well. Piercing cold spells deal half damage to these creatures (or one-quarter on a successful saving throw).  Creatures with the cold subtype can tell that a piercing cold spell is colder than normal, but they remain undamaged by the attack. Creatures with the fire subtype who are damaged by a piercing cold spell take double normal damage instead of the usual +50%. A piercing cold spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.
Primeval Wild Shape			TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Wild Shape																																																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Your wild shape forms are stronger than normal.																																																																																														SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:When you assume a wild shape form, you can opt to cause the shape assumed to be a primeval form of the creature that existed in the ancient past during a vast ice age. Doing so grants the new form a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to its natural armor, and resistance to cold 10. A primeval wild shape has a much shorter duration than normal, since the enhanced qualities of the new shape drain your supernatural energies much more quickly. A primeval wild shape has a duration of 1 round per druid level (or per level of the class that granted you the wild shape ability) instead of the normal 1 hour per druid level.
Primitive Caster				TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:You use screeches, wild gesticulations, and extra material components to give your spells additional power.																																																																																				SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:This feat only functions when you cast a spell that does not already have a verbal, somatic, or material component. For each component you voluntarily add, you increase the effective caster level of the spell by +1. You can only add a component thats not already present in the spell. For example, you cant add a somatic component to a gaseous form spell, because it already has one. You could add a verbal component, however. The verbal component you add consists of animalistic shouts, screams, and growls. The DC of Listen checks to hear you cast a spell is -5 (before modifying for distance). The somatic component is also more complex, so you must have two hands free to add a somatic component with this feat. The extra material component you add with this feat must be a rare plant found in the frostfell, which requires a successful DC 15 Profession (herbalist) check to locate.
Sea Legs					TYPE:General.Fighter																																																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:You are accustomed to the rolling motion on board a ship, and can use this motion to your advantage.																																																																																					SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:As long as you are on board a ship, you get a +2 bonus on all Balance and Tumble checks, and a +1 bonus on Initiative checks.
Smite Fiery Foe				TYPE:General																																																								PRETEXT:Smite Ability																			SAB:Smite fiery foe 1/day (Su) ~ +% attack, +% damage|CHA|TL																																																																																																																											DESC:You can smite creatures with the fire subtype.																																																																																														SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:Once per day, you may attempt to smite a creature with the fire subtype with a normal melee attack. When you activate this ability, your attack becomes infused with cold energy. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack roll and deal 1 extra point of cold damage per character level. If you smite a creature that does not have the fire subtype, the blast of cold does not manifest and the smite attempt is used up for that day. Remember that creatures with the fire subtype take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, including the additional damage dealt by this ability. You may swap out any daily uses of a smite ability gained by a character class or cleric domain to smite fiery foes instead.
Snowcasting					TYPE:General																																																PRESTAT:1,CON=13																																																																																																																																																																	DESC:You add ice or snow to your spells components to make them more powerful.																																																																																									SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it, the spell gains the cold descriptor. This does not actually change the nature of the spell you cast; a fireball cast with this feat still deals fire damage, but since it also carries the cold descriptor, it can be augmented by a number of feats listed in this chapter, such as Cold Focus and Frozen Magic. If you add a handful of snow or ice as an additional material component to a spell when you cast it and that spell already has the cold descriptor, you increase the effective level of the spell being cast by +1. Adding this additional material component requires you to spend a move action immediately before the spell is cast to gather fresh snow or ice from the surrounding environment. This snow or ice can be magically created by a conjuration spell, but no other ice manifested by a spell will do. You may take no other action between gathering the snow or ice and casting the spell.
Snowrunner					TYPE:General																																						PRESA:1,Woodland Stride (Ex)																																																																																																																																																																									DESC:You are particularly adept at moving through snow and over ice.																																																																																											SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:You can move through loose snow at full speed, as if you were moving across open terrain. You are also skilled at moving across open ice, and gain a +5 competence bonus on Balance checks to avoid slipping when you move across icy surfaces.
Snowflake Wardance			TYPE:General																										PREFEAT:1,Bardic Music														PRESKILL:1,Perform (Dance)=6																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:You have mastered the snowfl ake wardance, a mystical style of fighting with Slashing weapons that allows you to leap and almost seem to float haphazardly across the battlefield like a whirling, razor-edged snowflake.																																																																	SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Activating a snowflake wardance is a free action, and once activated, you add your Charisma modifier to your attack rolls with any Slashing melee weapon you wield in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse). You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load. A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform (dance). Performing a snowflake wardance is physically tiresomewhen the snowflake wardance ends, you become fatigued for the next 10 minutes.
Storm Magic					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:You gain a boost in spellcasting power during storms.																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:All spells you cast while you are affected by a storm (either natural or magical) manifest at +1 caster level.
Sugliin Mastery				TYPE:General.Fighter					PREATT:5																																																																			PREWEAPONPROF:1,Sugliin																																																																																																																																						DESC:You are a master at fighting with the massive sugliin.																																																																																													SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:You can attack with a sugliin as if it were a normal weapon, either making a single attack as a standard action or a full attack as a full-round action.
Winter's Champion				TYPE:General													PRECLASS:1,Paladin=1																																																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your paladin spell list is enhanced.																																																																																																SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:When you gain this feat, you may add the 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-level spells granted by the Cold and Winter domains as paladin spells of the same levels. You do not gain the ability to cast spells of these domains of 5th level or higher, nor do you gain the granted powers of the domains.																																																																																																																																																											SPELLLEVEL:CLASS|Paladin=1|Chill Touch,Snowsight|Paladin=2|Chill Metal,Snow Walk|Paladin=3|Sleet Storm,Winter's Embrace|Paladin=4|Ice Storm
Winter's Mount				TYPE:General																																																												PREVARGTEQ:SpecialMountLvl|0																																																																																																																																																			DESC:Your special mount is native to the frostfell.																																																																																														SOURCELONG:Frostburn	SOURCESHORT:frstbn	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:Your special mount gains the cold subtype. It gains immunity to cold, but has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. Your special mount is also hardier than a nonfrostfell version; it gains a +2 racial bonus to Constitution.
