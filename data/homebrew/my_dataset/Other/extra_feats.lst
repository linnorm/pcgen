Attune Magic Weapon	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Magic Arms and Armor	PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5																																DESC:Through your study of magic weapons, you have become adept at eking every advantage out of their enchanted qualities.														SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:When you wield a magic weapon, you gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. Special: You must spend 24 hours with a newly acquired weapon before you can gain this benefit when wielding it.
Bind Elemental		CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:ItemCreation	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wonderous Item		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=9																																DESC:You can craft magic items that use bound elementals for special effects, including weapons, armor, airships, and elemental galleons.												SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:Crafting an item with a bound elemental is similar to making a wondrous item, except that calling and binding an elemental is an integral part of creating the item. All bound-elemental items have a planar binding spell as a prerequisite, but simply casting the spell as part of the item creation is not sufficient. You must cast the spell normally, using the item that is to hold the elemental and a Khyber dragonshard as a receptacle. The elemental receives its normal saving throw to resist. While the elemental resides in the receptacle, you must compel it to accept bondage in the item by making an opposed Charisma check, as specified in the lesser planar binding spell description. If you are an artificer, this feat allows you to cast a planar binding spell by successfully emulating it with a Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + caster level), but only when you attempt to craft a bound-elemental item. In this case, your effective caster level equals your Use Magic Device check result -20 for the purpose of opposing the elemental's attempts to escape. See pages 265-267 for examples of bound-elemental items and vessels.

SOURCELONG:Magic of Eberron		SOURCESHORT:MoE		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:You can create a schema of a spell or infusion. Etching a minor schema takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a minor schema is its spell or infusion level × its caster level × 400 gp. To etch a minor schema, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. For rules on minor schemas, see page 122.

SOURCELONG:Magic of Eberron		SOURCESHORT:MoE		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:You can create and attach any elemental graft whose prerequisites you meet (see individual grafts in Chapter 5 for prerequisites). Creating and attaching an elemental graft follows the normal rules for creating a graft (see page 127).
Improved Homunculus	CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																				PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Construct],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ABILITY,Artificer ~ Craft Homunculus]	PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Craft=6			DESC:You are adept at improving and modifying your homunculus. Whenever you advance your homunculus's Hit Dice, you can also imbue it with special supernatural abilities.						SOURCELONG:Magic of Eberron		SOURCESHORT:MoE		SOURCEPAGE:p.49	BENEFIT:Your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its HD (see chart). If you use the Craft Construct feat to construct a homunculus, it gets these abilities when you create it. If you use the craft homunculus class feature of the artifi cer class, your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its current HD, and additional natural armor or special abilities if you later increase its HD. All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specifi ed, an ability can only be taken once. Each time the homunculus gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. For example, an artifi cer with a 4-HD homunculus that has the climber special ability could choose to give it sneak attack instead if the homunculus's Hit Dice were increased to 5. This feat applies to the character's homunculus regardless of its type. For new types of homunculi, see Chapter 6.

SOURCELONG:Magic of Eberron		SOURCESHORT:MoE		SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can hasten one infusion, imbuing it in 1 round, without spending an action point to do so. Normal: You can spend an action point to imbue an infusion in 1 round, even if the casting time is normally longer than 1 round. Special: You can choose this feat as an artifi cer bonus feat.
