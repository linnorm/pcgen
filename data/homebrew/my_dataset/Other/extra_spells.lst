For example, you could change a +2 flaming battleaxe to a +2 frost battleaxe or a ring of minor energ y resistance (acid) to a ring of minor energ y resistance (sonic). The amount of damage dealt by energy, protection offered from energy, and all other effects remain the same. Material Component: An alchemical ointment formed from materials representing all five energy types and costing 50 gp.
Enhancement Alteration										CLASSES:Artificer=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:S			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Weapon or shield touched																																		DURATION:10 min./level (D)				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)				SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:This spell has two distinct versions, both involving an alteration of an existing enhancement bonus. If you imbue a shield with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to shield bash attacks made with the shield instead of to the wielder's shield bonus to Armor Class. You can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion. If you imbue a weapon with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to the wielder's Armor Class if he chooses to fight defensively, uses the total defense action, uses the Combat Expertise feat, or uses the weapon in his off hand and has the Two- Weapon Defense feat. The enhancement bonus you shift no longer applies to the wielder's attack rolls and damage rolls with the weapon. As with the shield version, you can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion. If the weapon or shield is attended, the wielder can make a Will saving throw to negate the effect.
Hardening												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6|Artificer=7	DOMAINS:Artifice=6		SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./																														DURATION:Permanent					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes (object)				SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:DESC:This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more durable, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have a new hardness of 16 for purposes of ignoring damage caused by an opponent's successful sunder attempt. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. The hardening spell does not in any way affect the item's resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on. This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet of material per level of the caster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic feet per level.
Inflict Critical Damage										CLASSES:Artificer=4									SCHOOL:Transmutation																																																																											SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:As inf lict light damage, except inf lict critical damage deals 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

Iron Construct											CLASSES:Artificer=4									SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:S, M			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Construct touched																																			DURATION:1 min./level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)				SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You transform an existing construct into a powerhouse of hardened iron, similar to the effect of the iron body spell. The construct gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. It takes half damage from acid and fire attacks of all kinds. Even if it is not a golem, however, it becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. The construct gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity of 1). The construct's weight increases by a factor of five. Material Component: A small piece of iron that was once part of an iron golem, a hero's armor, or a war machine.
Item Alteration											CLASSES:Artificer=4									SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:S			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Magic item touched																																			DURATION:10 min./level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)				SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You alter an item that provides a certain type of bonus so that it provides a different type of bonus to the same value or roll. For example, you could change a ring of protection +1 so that it provided a natural armor bonus to Armor Class instead of a deflection bonus, or you could change a cloak of resistance so that it provided a circumstance bonus on saves instead of a resistance bonus. You cannot use this infusion to change an item so that it provides a sacred or profane bonus, nor can you change an item that already does so to make it provide a different kind of bonus. You also cannot make an item provide a dodge bonus to Armor Class.
Metamagic Item											CLASSES:Artificer=3									SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Spell trigger magic item touched																																DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)		SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You temporarily apply a metamagic feat you know to a single spell contained within a spell trigger item. For the duration of this infusion, anyone who casts that spell from the item gains the benefit of that metamagic feat. For example, you could imbue a wand of fireballs with the Empower Spell feat or apply the Maximize Spell feat to the cone of cold spell in a staff of frost.
Power Surge												CLASSES:Artificer=3									SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:S, XP			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Wand or staff touched																																		DURATION:1 min./level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No						SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:By touching a wand or staff that has at least 1 charge, you imbue it with 1 temporary charge per five caster levels.

The spell repairs 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).
Repair Moderate Damage										CLASSES:Artificer,Sorcerer,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Transmutation																																																																											SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:As repair light damage, except repair moderate damage repairs 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

Resistance Item											CLASSES:Artificer=1									SCHOOL:Abjuration		COMPS:S, M			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Item touched																																				DURATION:10 min./level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No						SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:A nonmagical item imbued with this infusion grants a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws to a character who wears or wields it. This bonus increases by 1 for every four caster levels (to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 8th level, +4 at 12th level, and so forth). Material Component: Oil mixed with various spices and minerals.
Shield of Faith, Legion's			KEY:Shield of Faith (Legion's)	CLASSES:Artificer,Cleric=4								SCHOOL:Abjuration											RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Allied creatures in a 20-ft.-radius burst																																																						SOURCELONG:Eberron Campaign Setting	SOURCESHORT:ECS		SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:This spell functions like shield of faith (see page 278 of the Player's Handbook), except that it affects multiple allies at a distance.

The item becomes, in effect, a wand with a single charge, which only you can use. You can imbue any spell of 4th level or lower into the item, as long as its spell level is no greater than one-half your artificer level. Your artificer level is the spell's caster level. You must make a successful Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + [spell level ? 3]) to emulate the spell and store it in the item. If you fail this check by 10 or more, you suffer a m ishap. T he DM determines t he r esult of a mishap, as with scroll mishaps. As a default, either the spell is activated immediately instead of being placed in the item, affecting you if possible, or the spell erupts in a burst of uncontrolled energy, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. A single item can carry only one spell at a time. You must provide any expensive material components or XP component the spell requires at the time you imbue it into the item. You must provide any focus the spell requires at the time you cast it from the item. XP Cost: Your caster level ? the spell level. For example, to place a scorching ray spell in an item, you must spend XP equal to your caster level x 2.

The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus.

The enhancement bonus provided by toughen construct stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
