Ancient Foe						KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Ancient Foe						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Due to his extensive study of dragons and training in the proper techniques for combating them, a darkwood stalker gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against dragons. He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against these creatures. A darkwood stalker also gets the bonus on damage with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet (the darkwood stalker cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus on damage does not apply against creatures that are im mune to critical hits. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the darkwood stalker's bonus goes up by +2. This bonus stacks with a favored enemy bonus (if any) acquired through ranger levels.

Uncanny Dodge					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Uncanny Dodge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge												DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a darkwood stalker gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a darkwood stalker already had the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

Sneak Attack					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:If a darkwood stalker can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for an extra 1d6 points of damage. For complete details on the sneak attack ability, see the description of the dark hunter earlier in this chapter.

Darkvision						KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Darkvision						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Although stealthy and keen-eyed, the darkwood stalker is often at a disadvantage against orcs when fighting in the darkness. Long ago, elven sages developed a ritual to allow the most dedicated stalkers to overcome this disadvantage. Now, as they grow in experience, their night vision continually improves, eventually matching the darkvision of their hated foes. At 4th level, a darkwood stalker gains darkvision out to 30 feet, and at 7th level, the range increases to 60 feet. If the darkwood stalker already has darkvision as a racial ability, this ability does not increase it.

Improved Uncanny Dodge				KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge												DESC:At 5th level and higher, a darkwood stalker can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies other characters the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack him. The exception to this defense is that a rogue of at least four levels higher than the character can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a darkwood stalker gains the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Dodge Critical					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Dodge Critical					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Although often more skilled than their dragon foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a darkwood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any, possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and he must declare his attempt to reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from the hit is rolled.

Death Attack					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Death Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:If a 10th-level darkwood stalker studies a particular dragon for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. While studying the dragon, the darkwood hunter can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the darkwood stalker or recognize the darkwood stalker as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the darkwood stalker's class level + the darkwood stalker's Wis modifier), he dies. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
