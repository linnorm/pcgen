# Ancient Foe.MOD					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Ancient Foe						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Due to his extensive study of dragons and training in the proper techniques for combating them, a darkwood stalker gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against dragons. He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against these creatures. A darkwood stalker also gets the bonus on damage with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet (the darkwood stalker cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus on damage does not apply against creatures that are im mune to critical hits. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the darkwood stalker's bonus goes up by +2. This bonus stacks with a favored enemy bonus (if any) acquired through ranger levels.

# Dodge Critical.MOD				KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Dodge Critical					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Although often more skilled than their dragon foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a darkwood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any, possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and he must declare his attempt to reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from the hit is rolled.

# Death Attack.MOD					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Death Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:If a 10th-level darkwood stalker studies a particular dragon for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. While studying the dragon, the darkwood hunter can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the darkwood stalker or recognize the darkwood stalker as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the darkwood stalker's class level + the darkwood stalker's Wis modifier), he dies. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
