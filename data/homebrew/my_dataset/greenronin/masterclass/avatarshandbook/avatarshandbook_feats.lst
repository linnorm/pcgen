Holy Summoner.MOD			BENEFIT:The duration of your Summon Monster spells increases by a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (%1 rounds).|max(CHA,0)
Imperative Summoning.MOD	BENEFIT:Any outsider with the Good subtype that you summon with a Summon Monster spell gets an extra move action on the round that it appeears.  Thereafter, the creature can take one additional extra move action in any single round that it chooses during the duration of the spell.  Note that if a summoned creature uses an extra move action it may still use a full-round action afterward.  e.g. A summoned creature may use an extra move action to move closer to an enemy and a full-round action to full attack it.
Rapid Summons.MOD			BENEFIT:You cast all Summon Monster and Summon Nature's Ally spells as standard actions rather than full-round actions.  The summoned creatures still appear at the beginning of your next turn.
Summoner's Bond.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever you cast a Summon Monster spell that calls an outsider with the Good subtype, you gain a +2 Sacred bonus to both your Charisma and Wisdom scores.  These bonuses last as long as the Summon Monster spell does.  If you summon multiple creatures, the resulting bonuses do not stack, but the overlap ensures that a +2 Sacred bonus remains in effect until the last creature has returned to its own plane.
