Code of Conduct				KEY:Samurai ~ Code of Conduct					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Samurai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A samurai must be of lawful alignment, and dishonors himself, his family, and his swords if he ever willingly commits a chaotic act. Additionally, the samurai code of bushido requires that he be obedient to his lord, accept death at any time and face it bravely, avenge any dishonor, and shun any appearance of cowardice. The core principles of bushido are honor, loyalty, and courage. Violating these precepts results in dishonor, which may result in a samurai being stripped of his family name or being asked to commit seppuku (ritual suicide).
